# Tungsten

From-scratch Rust 2D game engine. Stack: `winit` + `wgpu` + `glam` + hand-rolled ECS + manifest-driven assets. Targets: native only (`Linux`, `macOS`, `Windows`). No WASM.

## Status

Workspace `v0.21.0` on branch `0.21`. Phase 3 M24 (Tween System) is shipped. Phase 3 is complete; Phase 4 scope is under planning.

## Stack

Hand-rolled ECS with archetypal storage, deferred command buffers, and typed event queues; `wgpu` rendering; manifest-driven assets; `glyphon` text; `cpal` + `symphonia` + hand-rolled audio mixer; `notify` hot reload; `.tmj` / Tiled-compatible tilemaps; 2D AABB + circle physics with a uniform-grid broad-phase; frame telemetry, Criterion benches, and a perf capture workflow.

## Quick Start

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo run -p example-01-platformer      # comprehensive engine demo
cargo run -p example-02-sprite-stress   # canonical perf stress scene
cargo run -p example-03-scene-state     # scene/state + tween transition demo
```

Reproducible Linux perf capture:

```bash
WGPU_BACKEND=vulkan ./scripts/perf-capture.sh ecs-high-load 300   # primary scene (default)
WGPU_BACKEND=vulkan ./scripts/perf-capture.sh sprite-stress 300   # render-hot-path baseline
bash scripts/test-perf-capture.sh
```

## Read Order

- Human: `README.md` → `DESIGN.md` → `DECISIONS.md` → `AGENTS.md`
- AI agent: `AGENTS.md` → `docs/LLM_INDEX.md` → touched files only; use `DESIGN.md` for architecture and `DECISIONS.md` for rationale when needed
