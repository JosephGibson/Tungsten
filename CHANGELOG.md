## [0.3.0-alpha] - 2026-04-13

Phase 2 Milestone 8 — Audio.

### Added

- **Audio subsystem:** `cpal` output device init with a hand-rolled mixer running on a dedicated callback thread. Game code writes to `AudioCommands` resource; the audio thread drains it each callback. No async runtime (D-027, D-029).
- **Sound decoding:** `symphonia` decodes OGG/WAV/MP3/AAC files eagerly at startup into `SoundData` (f32 PCM). Linear interpolation resampling and mono→stereo upmix happen at decode time, so the mixer callback stays simple (D-028).
- **Sound manifest section:** `assets/manifest.json` extended with a `sounds` section (`looping`, `volume` fields with defaults). Sounds are loaded by string ID — consistent with the sprite/animation/font registry pattern.
- **Audio registry:** `SoundRegistry` resource (same pattern as `AssetRegistry`) maps string IDs → `AudioHandle(u32)`. `AudioHandle` is opaque and cheap to copy.
- **`AudioCommands` resource:** `play()`, `play_looping()`, `play_with()`, `stop()`, `stop_all()`, `set_master_volume()` — synchronous API from any system.
- **`AudioSystem` integration in `App`:** Initialized after the startup callback (so sounds are decoded first). Non-fatal if no audio device is available (logs a warning and continues).
- **`KeyCode` variants:** Added `KeyM`, `Digit1`, `Digit2`, `Digit3` to the engine key enum and input bridge.
- **`exit_on_escape` on `App`:** `set_exit_on_escape(false)` lets game code claim the Escape key for pause menus.
- **`assets/sounds/`:** `sfx_blip.ogg` (short one-shot blip) and `music_main.ogg` (30-second looping tone).
- **`example-07-audio`:** Demonstrates one-shot SFX (Space), looping music toggle (M), master volume levels (1/2/3), and stop-all (S), with live status text using M7 fonts.
- **DECISIONS.md D-027–D-030:** `cpal`, `symphonia`, hand-rolled mixer, and M12 conditional framing.

### Changed

- Workspace version bumped to `0.3.0-alpha`.
- AGENTS.md: structured AI session workflow (startup checklist, session types, principles checklist).
- DESIGN.md: audio architecture section, resolved Phase 2 gating questions table.
- PHASE2.md: M8 complete, M12 conditional on ECS pain.
- CLAUDE.md: current status updated to M8 complete.

## [0.2.0-alpha.0] - 2026-04-12

Phase 2 Milestone 7 — Text rendering.

### Added

- **Text rendering pipeline:** GPU text rendering via `glyphon` (built on `cosmic-text` + `swash`), integrated alongside the existing quad and sprite pipelines in `tungsten-render` (D-026).
- **Font manifest section:** `assets/manifest.json` extended with a `fonts` section. Fonts are loaded by string ID, never by file path — consistent with the sprite/animation registry pattern.
- **Font loading:** TTF/OTF files decoded and registered at startup. Three font families staged in `assets/fonts/`: Inter (sans), Source Serif 4 (serif), JetBrains Mono (mono).
- **Text extraction API:** `ExtractTextFn` added to `App`; `TextSection` type in `tungsten-render` for specifying text content, position, font ID, size, and color. The renderer resolves font IDs at draw time via an internal atlas.
- **`example-06-text`:** Demonstrates multi-font text rendering, labels at fixed positions, and a live FPS overlay using the debug text path.
- **DECISIONS.md D-026:** Rationale for `glyphon`/`cosmic-text` under D-015 rule 2.

## [0.1.0-alpha] - 2026-04-12

Phase 1 complete (milestones M0 through M6).

### Added

- **Workspace scaffold:** Three-crate Cargo workspace (`tungsten-core`, `tungsten-render`, `tungsten`) with pinned dependencies and `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- **Hand-rolled ECS:** `World` with entity lifecycle, type-erased component storage, singleton resources, and typed queries (`query`, `query_entities`). Panic on programmer error, `Option` on runtime lookups (D-022).
- **wgpu renderer:** GPU initialization, surface management, window resizing, and a clear-color render pass. Shaders embedded via `include_str!` from `.wgsl` files (D-023).
- **Colored-quad pipeline:** Instanced rendering of axis-aligned colored rectangles with an orthographic camera.
- **Textured-sprite pipeline:** Instanced sprite rendering with per-sprite nearest/linear filter modes (D-011), a GPU texture pool keyed by opaque `TextureHandle`s (D-016), and alpha blending.
- **Data-driven config:** `tungsten.json` loaded at startup via `serde_json`, with sensible defaults when the file is missing (D-008).
- **Manifest-driven asset loading:** `assets/manifest.json` registers sprites and animations by string ID. Paths resolve relative to the manifest. Multiple manifests compose by extension with fatal duplicate-ID checks (D-017). Validation catches missing files and unresolved sprite references at load time (D-009).
- **Frame-based animation:** Custom JSON animation format with per-frame sprite IDs and durations (D-010). `AnimationState` component advances frames, supports looping and one-shot playback, and guards against zero-duration infinite loops.
- **Edge-triggered input:** Keyboard and mouse input with `is_pressed`, `just_pressed`, and `just_released` semantics. Engine-specific key/button enums decoupled from `winit` via an input bridge.
- **Frame timing:** `DeltaTime` resource updated each frame.
- **Five examples:** `01_window` (clear screen), `02_ecs` (stdout ECS demo), `03_dots` (bouncing quads with keyboard/mouse input), `04_sprites` (textured sprites from manifest), `05_animation` (looping walk cycle).
